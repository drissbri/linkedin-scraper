# LinkedIn Scraper RESTful API

## Overview

This project is a LinkedIn Scraper built using Selenium for web scraping and FastAPI for serving the scraped data via RESTful APIs. It allows users to fetch detailed profile and company information from LinkedIn based on the provided LinkedIn ID.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- git

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/drissbri/linkedin-scraper`.

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows, run `venv\Scripts\activate`.
     - On macOS/Linux, run `source venv/bin/activate`.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Configuration

**Environment Variables**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN="YourLinkedInAccessToken"
     LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXP=AccessTokenExpiration
     HEADLESS=True
     ```
   - Replace `"YourLinkedInAccessToken"` and `"AccessTokenExpiration"` with your actual LinkedIn access token and its expiration time.
   - Change  `"HEADLESS"` to False if you dont want the browser to open in headless mode.

### Obtaining LinkedIn Access Token with Cookie-Editor

To fetch data using the LinkedIn Scraper, you'll need a LinkedIn access token. The following steps will guide you through obtaining this token using the Cookie-Editor browser addon:

#### Step 1: Install Cookie-Editor

- **Install Cookie-Editor**: Add the [Cookie-Editor](https://cookie-editor.com/) addon to your browser. It's available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-editor), and other popular browsers. Visit the addon store for your browser and search for "Cookie-Editor" to install.

#### Step 2: Access LinkedIn

- **Log into LinkedIn**: Open your browser and log into your LinkedIn account as you normally would.

#### Step 3: Open Cookie-Editor

- **Launch Cookie-Editor**: Once logged in, click on the Cookie-Editor icon in your browser's toolbar to open the addon.

#### Step 4: Find the Access Token

- **Search for Access Token**: In the Cookie-Editor interface, look for a cookie named `li_at` or similar. This cookie contains your LinkedIn access token.

- **Copy the Token**: Click on the `li_at` cookie to view its details, and copy the value. This is your LinkedIn access token.
- **Copy the expiration time**: Convert the Expiration time into numeric format (timestamp) like `1743212774.0` , and copy the value. This is your LinkedIn access token expiration time.


### Notes
- **Token Validity**: LinkedIn access tokens are temporary. Ensure to check the token's validity periodically and update it as needed.
- **Privacy and Security**: Handle your access token securely as it grants access to your LinkedIn data. Do not share your token publicly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you continue to encounter issues with the access tokens being undefined or expired even after following these steps, please replace the values directly in the `settings.py` file.**

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```shell
python run.py
```

This command will start the Uvicorn server and make the API accessible on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## API Endpoints

The LinkedIn Scraper offers endpoints for retrieving detailed profile and company information from LinkedIn. Here's what you can expect from each:

### Profile Data

- **GET** `/profile-data/{linkedin_id}`
  - Fetches profile information for the specified LinkedIn ID.
  - **Path Parameters:**
    - `linkedin_id`: The unique LinkedIn ID of the profile.
  - **Response:** JSON object containing the profile information as per the provided format.
  - **Response Format:**
    ```json
    {
      "linkedin_id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "headline": "string",
      "education": {
        "positions": ["string"],
        "institutions": ["string"],
        "dates": ["string"]
      },
      "experience": {
        "positions": ["string"],
        "institutions": ["string"],
        "dates": ["string"]
      }
    }
    ```
  - The `education` and `experience` fields are objects that include arrays of strings for positions, institutions, and dates, providing a concise summary of the individual's educational background and work history.

### Company Data

- **GET** `/company-data/{linkedin_id}`
  - Fetches company information based on the given LinkedIn ID.
  - **Path Parameters:**
    - `linkedin_id`: The unique LinkedIn ID of the company.
  - **Response:** JSON object containing the company information as structured below.
  - **Response Format:**
    ```json
    {
      "linkedin_id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "industry": "string",
      "about": "string"
    }
    ```
  - This format outlines the company's LinkedIn ID, name, industry sector, and a brief description of the company in the `about` field.

## Error Handling

Error handling is consistent across endpoints, aiming to provide meaningful feedback in case of failures:

- **Example Error Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Error fetching profile details"
  }
  ```
  This response is returned with an HTTP status code of 500, indicating a server-side error during data fetching, along with a detail message explaining the error.

## Notes

- Ensure that the LinkedIn access token is valid and not expired to avoid authentication errors.
